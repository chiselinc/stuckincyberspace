# BlockChainSides Vancouver 2017 - A Blockchain Tech-tivus for the Rest of Us!

**April 5, 2017 -- 436 West Pender Street, Vancouver, BC**

**Sponsored by the [Human Data Commons Foundation](http://www.humandatacommons.org) in partnership with [Blockchain@UBC](http://www.blockchainubc.ca/)**

## Why a "Bsides"?

The tradition of "Bsides" conferences in the technology sector arose from the financial barriers to access mainstream conferences that bring people from all around the world. The Bsides concept is personally meaningful to me due to my working-class background, my currently massive reserve of high-interest student debt, and the fact that volunteering [Bsides Vancouver Information Security Conference](https://bsidesvancouver.com/) was my first real entry to the local tech scene about 3 years ago. If developers, hackers and hobbyists can't pay the exorbitant fees to get into the "big conferences," [by George](https://youtu.be/vn_PSJsl0LQ), we'll build our own on a shoestring budget and grassroots volunteers!

## Room for Risk-Taking

Additionally, mainstream industry events are often limited to presentations and discussions about larger, fully funded, and often "safer" projects, the blockchain hackerspace community can provide a window into the most cutting edge and creative hands on work being conducted in the field. There is significant advantage, in this regard, to not being "too big to fail." Trying out new tools at the micro-level, in face-to-face communities, enables much more sustainable and reliable macro-level projects upon scaling.

In short, we can move more effectively and rapidly toward "trustless trust" systems if the transition plan involves experiments within "trust-full trust" communities.
