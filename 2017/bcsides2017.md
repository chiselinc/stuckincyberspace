![April 5 2017 - BCSides Vancouver Free Drop-in Blockchain Summit](/images/2017projects/techtivus.png)

The tradition of "Bsides" conferences in the technology sector arose from the financial barriers to access mainstream conferences that bring people from all around the world. The Bsides concept is meaningful to me both due to my working-class background, currently massive reserve of student debt, and the fact that volunteering [Bsides Vancouver Information Security Conference](https://bsidesvancouver.com/) was my first real entry to the local tech scene about 3 years ago. If developers, hackers and hobbyists can't pay the exorbitant fees to get into the "big conferences," by George, we'll build our own on a shoestring budget and grassroots volunteers!
