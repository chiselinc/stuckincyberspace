# Blockchain Resource Guide

Compiled by Chelsea Palmer on March 8, 2017. This will be a living document, and submission of new links is encouraged: [please submit these via comments on the relevant issue on my github repository.](https://github.com/chiselinc/stuckincyberspace/issues/4)

## Immediate Opportunities to Engage:

### Upcoming Vancouver, BC Blockchain Events

The first week of April has turned into a regular **blockstravaganza**, with multiple major events and collaboration across sectors. We welcome you to get involved in any and all of these opportunities to connect with other blockchain and decentralization enthusiasts.

**[April 4: IEEE Blockchain Special Interest Group Presents the First Annual Blockchain Industry Summit - ](http://blockchain.ieee.org/2017-blockchain-summit/)**

**[April 5: Human Data Commons Foundation (in association with IEEE) Presents the Blockchain "BCSides" Free Community Event](http://stuckincyber.space/2017/bcsides2017)**

**[April 5 (Evening): Decentralized Autonomous Soiree: When Blockchain Worlds Collide](https://www.picatic.com/VanBCSides2017) It will be a rollicking good time at dctrl with homebrewed beer!**

**[April 7 & 8: Local Node of Global Coinfest 2017](https://www.meetup.com/bitcoinvan/events/237974269/)**

### IEEE Blockchain Special Interest Group

The prestigious IEEE has been instrumental in the progress of technology from the very beginning of electricity itself. It's exciting to be involved with their Blockchain Special Interest Group, chaired by Greg Adamson; this group is getting ahead of the curve on identifying standards, shaping policy, and supporting innovative development in the blockchain scene, especially in applications outside of simple fintech.

### Blockchain@UBC

Blockchain@UBC builds upon a similarly prestigious foundation, the University of British Columbia. Blockchain@UBC serves as a research cluster fostering academic collaboration with industry, government, and nonprofit groups. The cluster lead, Victoria Lemieux, brings a dynamic and critical background in archival science to the table, laying down what I think has been a missing element in the technical conversation: verifiability of records as it applies to human civilization, not just numbers and hashes.

### dctrl Vancouver Hackerspace

I like to say that dctrl is located in the most exciting basement in British Columbia... though I'm highly biased as a central organizer. dctrl is a community commons-modeled non-hierarchical collective, with a focus on blockchain technology and decentralization. We operate as a transparent "do-ocracy," meaning that if a member has an idea that doesn't violate any of our rules or significantly impact others in the space, they can run with it! This leads to all sorts of cool projects, from event hosting and collaborative workgroups, to Internet of Things projects linked into the bitcoin blockchain. Plus we play a lot of ping pong and jam out with a great sound system.

### CoinFest 2017 [April 7-8, 2017 -- 436 West Pender Street]

Originally started in Vancouver, CoinFest is a grassroots community event celebrating the beauty and wonder that is Bitcoin.

### 2016 Decentralized Web Summit

I had the honor of attending the first annual DWeb Summit, hosted at the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org) in San Francisco. With Tim Berners-Lee, Brewster Kahle, and Vint Cerf among the keynote speakers, the focus was on using blockchain technology to revive and protect the original vision of a free and open internet. Plus, thanks to the lovely Wendy Hanamura, I weaseled my way on stage to rap about the historical tension between surveillance and liberation in tech innovation!
