# dctrl drop in free school/global conference node/socratic cafe - initial proposal

## Problem
The shift toward an information-based labour economy necessitates unrestricted and fair access to knowledge and skills training in the tech sector. One of the remaining barriers to this access is the increasing cost of secondary education -- even coding bootcamps can carry a stiff price.

## Solution
The "free school" concept -- anchored in the traditions of radical and collaborative community commons spaces -- breaks down this barrier, and operates based on principles of inclusivity, co-learning, and transparency.

## Structure
A daytime drop-in program for community members to view streaming live global tech conferences and curated thematic lectures, as well as engaging in hands-on workshops and discussion groups.

## Bonus Value Adds

* pulls attention to Vancouver blockchain scene [perhaps eventually granting us more influence in relationship to the conferences we stream, get some more VCs and startups in town]
* bridging perceived gaps between devs and business folk

## Spring 2017 Prototype Design

**When**: March 20th through April 20th, three times a week.
**Where**: 436 West Pender Street, Vancouver, BC.

**Prep Work**: Curated calendar chosen and updated on public site a week in advance. Crowdsourced input for what we should watch/talk about
**Content Focus**: intro to intermediate level blockchain, in preparation for April activities [IEEE Industry Summit, BCSides, CoinFest2017]
**Ideas for Content**: track down previous IEEE and Internet Society conferences, screen intro videos in public-promoted short session at least once a week, Vitalik speeches, previous work of upcoming conference presenters
**Collaborative Partners Strategy**: open invite and transparent operations [post meeting minutes etc]. Having a followup steering meetup *about* the project *during* the project [akin to participatory action research model], potentially debriefing the week after CoinFest ends?

**Daily Setup**: Open around 9:00 (depending upon day's viewing schedule), setup coffee etc and stream video. Discussion around the content will be encouraged, and a time buffer will be allotted to allow attendees to debrief and share their thoughts. Except for Commons-wide events, drop-in will cease at 18:00 daily.

## Resources

* Existing, well-loved and geographically ideal space
* Projector setup [**need new projector though**]
* Excellent audio setup, microphones, etc
* [Soon to be] top-of-the-line desktop computer
* Pledged support in partnership with key players in the blockchain space

## Needs

* As above, new projector [Kiko estimates $750-1000]
* Small budget for coffee etc
* Helper for finalizing curation schedules
* Helper for designing assessment/metrics
* Cross-pollination with all partners for visibility

## Target Attendees

* Students [UBC, SFU, Emily Carr, CDM, code camps] - flat access pass from the institution and/or classes taking "field trips" to relevant sessions?
* Freelancers
* 9-5 professionals in the gastown area (come by for a lunch break)
* Potential employers/recruiters for dev talent
* Visiting decentralization enthusiasts
* Soft sciences academics who want to learn more about the tech side of things
* Media coverage, potential patrons, etc
* [And just like the Decentralized Dance Party...] most of all, the people who just stumble onto it randomly and it changes their life's course forever!


## Ethically Navigating Across Sectors

### Asks for more radical partners [hackers, devs, grassroots community organizers]

* "Don't be evil" -- but, like, *for real* this time.
* The collaboration will operate as a *project*, not a steering device for the larger community commons
  * The Members Club will regularly check in during meetings to voice any concerns about the use of the space, and the legal/governance relationship with partners
* Appropriate operational costs are fundraised and space equipment is kept shipshape
* Any media, intellectual property, etc that arises in the space belongs first and foremost to its creator [individual agreements can be made for first access etc., but creative production cannot be exploited]
* All financials are transparent, ideally cryptocurrency based, and the structure eventually feeds into the project bounty system [in a "tithing" sense]

### Asks from more formal partners [academic institutions, private sector, policymaking]

* positive metrics outcome on trial run
* visibility/acknowledgement for partner sponsors
* active engagement of academic students with material that is "moving too fast" for mainstream curriculum to keep up with
* pool of "HQP" (which I think is kind of a gross/objectifying labour concept)
* the program must be self-sustaining eventually, and ready to move to another space if it becomes necessary

## Eventual Metrics of Analysis/Application

* Connecting the concepts of what makes this successful to Sandy Pentland's work
* Anonymous attendee count and opt-in participant feedback
