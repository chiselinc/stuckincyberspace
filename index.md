# **Homesite of Chelsea Palmer [aka msGNU]**
This is where all my stuff lives-- personal, professional, musical, and academic. Feel free to poke around. The primary content, at present, is related to the 2015-2016 project "Stuck in Cyberspace," originally a Master's Thesis which was transformed into a nine song nerd rap album.

I made a video for each song, as well-- the entire playlist is embedded below, or visit the "SiC album" navigation link above to check out individual video pages!
