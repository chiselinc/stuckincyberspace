# **Chelsea Palmer [aka msGNU] presents "Stuck in Cyberspace"**
The primary contents of this site are related to the 2015-2016 project "Stuck in Cyberspace," originally a Master's Thesis which was transformed into a nine song nerd rap album. It's an educational journey through the history of computer technology, its social effects on human beings, and a touch of Foucauldian theory!

I made a video for each song, as well-- the entire playlist is embedded below, or visit the "SiC album" navigation link above to check out individual video pages!
