		<p>Welcome to the barebones launch of my thesis website, enacted through a cringing revisitation of basic HTML/CSS. For now, I think getting the material links up to my writing is more crucial than making a fancy pretty little site... after all, I kind of miss <a href="http://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/web-1-0/32191">Web 1.0</a> when everything was quite easy to parse.</p> 

		<p>The following are links to Google Docs of the various sections of this aforementioned Master's Thesis. Yes, I capitulated, long ago, to the all-encompassing tyrant that is Google, and I for one welcome <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/chelsea-palmer-79280ab5">our Alphabet overlords</a> [/sarcasm].</p>

When life gets less hectic I'll footnote cite these.</p>

				<ul style="list-style-type:none">			
					<li>This is pretty boring/stiffly academic, but it lays the groundwork for the theoretical framework [<b>anti-oppressive Community Psychology</b> and <b>Foucauldian notions of power</b>] and the assumptions I've made [that it is totally valid and awesome to use informal journalism to comment upon contemporary events!].</li>

				<ul style="list-style-type:none">	
					<li>The concept of the 'technological unconscious' refers to the fact that as we universally adapt to new technology, it becomes nearly invisible in our daily lives. Does the development of new tech lean toward a net positive, or toward a dangerous creep of consumer data collection?</li>
				</ul>
	<h3><b>Fun topics!</b></h3>
						<ul>
						<li>the swift advance of the Internet of Things, machine learning, and bioinformatics</li>
						<li>wasting "timeless time" scrolling through endless websites </li>

				<ul style="list-style-type:none">				
					<li>As we increasingly use the Internet as a central source of knowledge, and indeed, almost as a substitute for short-term memory, it's crucial to investigate the validity of mainstream sources of information -- most prominently, Google Search and Wikipedia.</li>
				</ul>
	<h3><b>Fun topics!</b></h3>
						<ul>
						<li>the Google-Wikipedia feedback loop </li>
						<li>Paulo Freire and critical consciousness</li>
						<li>checking sources and avoiding the echo-chamber effect</li>
						</ul>

				<ul style="list-style-type:none">				
					<li>Visibility and public shaming have been drastically increased by the rise of social media. Fame and infamy can be instantaneous, and their subjects have little control over the trajectory of their public images. How far into the extreme might this go?</li>
				</ul>
	<h3><b>Fun topics!</b></h3>

				<ul style="list-style-type:none">				
					<li>A lot of people "talk the talk" in terms of supporting political and social causes online, but too often this gets limited to "slacktivism." This passive participation is exacerbated by the skewed representation of vocal Internet users in terms of demographic diversity. How can we utilize the Internet's capabilities to yield positive outcomes from people's genuine desires to participate?</li>
				</ul>
	<h3><b>Fun topics!</b></h3>
						<ul>
						<li>Clicking "Like" is not the same as taking action</li>
						<li>As long as Silicon Valley lacks diversity, so will the technology it produces</li>
						<li>Can we "meme-ify" and gamify truly effective activist strategies?</li>
						</ul>

				<ul style="list-style-type:none">
				
					<li>Since the origins of information and communication technology, there has been both collaboration and competition between government interests, academic exploration, and hobbyist innovation. As systematic surveillance increases in scope, this tension is coming to a boil, as "hackers" are vilified, and control over the internet is centralized.</li>
				</ul>
	<h3><b>Fun topics!</b></h3> 			
						<ul>
						<li>Government control from ARPANET to RFID chips and IMSI-catchers</li>
						<li>White Hat and Black Hat hacktivism: bug bounties, Wikileaks, ransomware</li>
						<li>4chan, anonymity, and drawing lines in the sand</li>

				<ul style="list-style-type:none">
				
					<li>Advanced technology has long been hailed as a potential means to pursue equitable access to resources and a universally improved quality of life. The so-called "sharing economy" provides opportunities for cooperative trade and labour, but it also reduces protection of worker rights and stable employment. </li>
				</ul>
	<h3><b>Fun topics!</b></h3>		
						<ul>
						<li>The imprecise distinction between "employers" and "platform providers"</li>
						<li>The illusion of corporate benevolence -- what does "Don't Be Evil" really mean?</li>
						<li>Users producing data and media content for free, freelancers opening themselves up to risks and liabilities</li>

				<ul style="list-style-type:none">					
					<li>The population Global South, often referred to in terms of "developing" or "Third World" nations, consistently exhibits innovative use of limited resources [called <em>jugaad</em> in Hindi-Urdu], particularly in the age of cell phone technology. By examining the creativity of these "hacks," we can begin to envision the near future of grassroots progress in technology. </li>
				</ul>
	<h3><b>Fun topics!</b></h3>
						<ul>
						<li>Global South community values parallel the foundational philosophy of Free and Open Source Software </li>
						<li>Creative use of mobile technology in Africa for microfinance, health and safety tracking, and disseminating education </li>
