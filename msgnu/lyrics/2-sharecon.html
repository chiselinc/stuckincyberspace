<br>

new age of labour<br>

do yourself a favor<br>

crowdsource a plan and connect with your neighbour<br>

stockpile video footage<br>

mix it up<br>

act quick before the copyright gets more corrupt<br>
<br>

i'm pitching a tent in the creative commons<br>

i wanna eat a steak but i can only buy ramens<br>

when I write a parody, call it fair use<br>

you're just playing at being obtuse, you gold goose<br>

navigating these laws, what's really hard is<br>

swallowing the fact that you keep the profits from the artist<br>

garbage top 40, so we make our own station<br>

got support thanks to the electronic frontier foundation<br>
<br>

output gettin DRM'd by the DMCA<br>

if every phrase has been used then i've got nothing to say<br>

this is why we conceptualized the public domain<br>

omnipresent innovations gettin deep in your brain<br>
<br>

new creations rely on the shoulders of giants<br>

can't construct disruptive developments minus defiance<br>

true societal progress should be based on alliance<br>

rock a peer review method like this is hard science<br>

divisive legal battles only benefit the bigwhigs<br>

here on the bottom we're stuck with free craigslist gigs<br>

but there's hope in the heart of every musician i know.<br>

and we put it all out there like a free sideshow.<br>

<br><br>

who owns the future? that's what we ask<br>

half full glass, web platforms tap that cask<br>

while the middle class gets buried in a stratified casket<br>

record execs stack residuals in a basket<br>

any chance of policy reform, they will mask it<br>

when they drop new singles like a tisket, a tasket<br>

look at the gumption as they exploit prosumption!<br>

no break from the workday, you better bring your lunch in!<br>
<br>

such a narrow range of options<br>

we're busking to our coffins<br>

we don't see any other way to go<br>

but i'm still grinning and running<br>

hope a new day's coming<br>

even though it's surely coming slow
