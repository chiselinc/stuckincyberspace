What the Foucault?

Sayin who the Michel<br>

He's got all the other theorists perplexed as hell<br>

So go ahead and yell<br>

Cos you fear you don't get it<br>

Or just open up your ears<br>

So I can hit you quick wit it<br>
<br>

First thing to know - power isn't some sovereign force<br>

Dorks think they can charge overlords with sharpened forks<br>

We all perpetuate<br>

The structures that we say we hate<br>

If there's an oppressive system<br>

We had a bit to create<br>
<br>
As in we implicate ourselves in it<br>

This ain't a lottery or race, we can't win it,<br>

and I'll get to that more thoroughly in just a minute<br>
<br>

For now suffice to say power is a network of strategies<br>

I'm just the messenger so don't get mad at me,<br>

Instead of words real control plays out through our anatomy<br>

this reality is simultaneously terrifying and so rad, you see<br>
<br>

The panopticon doesn't work the way some people think it do<br>

It really make the prisoner do all the surveillance for you<br>

If you don't know when you're watched, it might as well be all the time<br>

We used to take a pound of flesh, now we brand you for your crime<br>
<br>

<i>power is tolerable as long as it masks its true intentions<br>

we adapt our behaviour to routine social conventions<br>

our acquiescence constructs the present, i forgot to mention<br>

the illusion of total inclusion trickles down like a pension</i><br>
<br>

Wonder what the hell is water as the fish grow wetter<br>

Discipline and index, hang a scarlet letter,<br>

Indelibly ink your legal name in a ledger,<br>

label your deviance with shame, it works better<br>
<br>

Render bodies docile with proscribed practices<br>

Free actions are fossils, we'll make you think you asked for this<br>

Normative behaviour adapts to the episteme!<br>

What was once acceptable is rendered as a fading dream!<br>
<br>

They'll call you mad and put you on a ship of fools<br>

you confess about sex, the priest quietly drools<br>

pure biopower growing thicker by the hour<br>

productive not repressive, concrete cracks for the flower<br>
<br>

systemic classification sometimes makes me feel hated<br>

but my body's just an object to be manipulated<br>

regimented blurry-eyed rituals of health<br>

preoccupied by technologies of the self<br>
<br>

there are things we love about the way we're oppressed<br>

button up your favourite brand name as you get dressed<br>

social systems wouldn't last without giving us pleasure<br>

gettin dizzy as we chase what we're taught to call treasure<br>

and we consent to resented commands even within our leisure<br>
