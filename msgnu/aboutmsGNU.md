# Who's msGNU?

## Slapdash Aesthetic

### There's No Accounting for [Childish] Taste

I've never produced something polished or smooth. I like the dollar store and the backroom junk at Goodwill. And I like to reuse everything I've ever owned until it breaks down into pieces.

I like nostalgia, uneven edges, and bright colours. And jump cuts.  I don't care how jarring they are, I'll always take a hard cut over a proper transition.

In short, I share my aesthetic tastes with a lot of 6 year olds. I never grew out of goofy Crayola-style crafts, and I don't intend to. This is what makes me laugh, and laughing keeps depression, confusion, and exasperation at bay. I mean, if you're into it, you're into it. If not, there are plenty of other music videos in the sea.

As long as I can tool around with goofy stuff, I'll be happy.

### Budget as Cheap as the Day is Long

I've generally produced all of my artistic projects on a near-zero budget, except for going out of pocket on weird stuff from dollar stores and thrift stores. In addition to this Yankee-spirited thriftiness, the majority of the props and costumes used for "Stuck in Cyberspace" hold great personal significance for me. These videos are filled with objects from my childhood home and 15+ year old outfits (because I stopped getting taller at age 14). Most significantly, the live

Some of it may not fit or make sense. I brought it in anyways because to me, art is deeply personal. Clothes I decorated when I was 16, my two dolls from when I was young. It's almost as though layering my current artistic output with the vestiges of the past 20 years helps me tie up loose ends, psychologically. I take the time to appreciate the pieces of the puzzle, the little details that shaped who I am today.

### We Are Nothing Without the People We Love

Most consistently and crucially in *stuck in cyberspace*; I used possessions that belong to my Nana. These  had been collected and boxed up after she moved to a nursing home. She lived with us my whole life, and she's incredibly important to me.

Nana loved Kirk from the very first episode of Star Trek TOS, and the Shatner pictures are hers. Cloth backdrops, cowboy alarm clocks, clay animals-- these are all Nana's. I want to honour her quirky and beautiful taste in decoration and surroundings to the best of my ability.

And perhaps strangest of all is msGNU's Foucault-chasing wedding dress. Nana and her mother handmade it for her 1949 wedding. She wanted to just get rid of it,

I wanted to instead highlight it, give it a second life. It fits perfectly and I dyed it blue and painted the binary code for *msGNU* on the front.

I will take care of it to the best of my ability, even long after it stops fitting. It will be a marker of the hardworking, kind, and loving woman who raised four kids on her own in small town New England.

### Unfinished Art: The Perfect is the Enemy of the Good

...at least in my opinion. So I've always been more interested in slapping things together and getting them out there, while I'm still fiercely passionate, instead of worrying about perfecting the details. I will always look back on any song, video, or writing that I produce with at least a slight cringe, a critical eye, so I may as well just keep pushing forward. As DJ Khaled *[HYPERLINK]* advises... "Another one. And another one. And another one."

### Intentional Vulnerability

Making such fleeting, construction-paper-style, childlike art, I realize that I'm putting myself out there. I have no interest in being cool in this sense. I mean, like many people, I worry about being cool in the day to day throngs of social things, but this doesn't extend to the rapping.

The rapping and videomaking just makes me happy, deep inside, it makes me feel like I've found my place. So it's fine if you end up laughing at me instead of with me. I'm okay with being pigeonholed as a weird nerd, as long as I can keep pushing and performing and growing.
