## Lyrics

let's talk about the internet of things!<br>
microchips hulked out, grew wings<br>
twitter telling me why the caged drone sings<br>
automated fixations are just what tomorrow brings.<br>
<br>
hearing minor autotuned chords<br>
deep embedded circuit boards<br>
instant messages comin from your home's chairs and floors<br>
all sorts of ways they can improve your days<br>
simultaneously turn your life into albee plays.<br>
<br>
sayin the surveillance comes and goes<br>
your bluetooth is proof that friends and foes both see ya, goof<br>
google earth satellite zoomin in on your roof<br>
fetch your mail in a robe and you'll look like a doof.<br>
<br>
and why ya gettin paper bills anyhow?<br>
the new tech is here, so get with the now<br>
it's hip to be square if that square is a cellphone<br>
moore's law begets tiny tech, i'll never ever be alone again<br>
phone a friend, it's the ten thousand dollar question<br>
too scared to be a rapper when the wicked wiretappers<br>
are most likely listening in.<br>
<br>
are you root? no, seriously, are you root, dude?<br>
if you are root you can address me in a stern mood<br>
but apt-get your shitty attitude out the room<br>
or i'll rm you into the trash like a broom.<br>
<br>
machines are learning, are your ears burning<br>
profits gossip with everything lossless<br>
nintendo secret level or you're fighting with the bosses<br>
cos skynet insists that its logic is flawless.<br>
<br>
(**x2**) technological unconsciousness<br>
your surroundings will surpass the turing test<br>
bitcoin, dogecoin, or coinye west<br>
young folks invest cos they're hashtag blessed.<br>
<br>
blaze up a doober in the driverless uber<br>
the misstep recorded by the commuter computer<br>
then you hear as the central speaker system parrots<br>
"passenger your punishment is five demerits"<br>
<br>
but we need tech that's holistic, not prescriptive<br>
each human being supported as uniquely gifted<br>
open access data helps us know ourselves better<br>
biomedical analysis for healthy go-getters<br>
goal-setters gamifying life's big challenges<br>
turning bad habits into steadier balances<br>
<br>
find a next level you!<br>
choose what to do<br>
universal will to become shows vonnegut knew<br>
our brains are neuroplastic and our limits porous<br>
so collaborative growth is really working for us.
