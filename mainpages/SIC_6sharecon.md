<h2 id='lyrics'> Lyrics </h2>

new age of labour<br>
do yourself a favor<br>
crowdsource a plan and connect with your neighbour<br>
stockpile video footage<br>
mix it up<br>
act quick before the copyright gets more corrupt<br>

i'm pitching a tent in the creative commons<br>
i wanna eat a steak but i can only buy ramens<br>
when I write a parody, call it fair use<br>
you're just playing at being obtuse, you gold goose<br>

navigating these laws, what's really hard is<br>
swallowing the fact that you keep the profits from the artist<br>
garbage top 40, so we make our own station<br>
got support thanks to the electronic frontier foundation<br>

output gettin DRM'd by the DMCA<br>
if every phrase has been used then i've got nothing to say<br>
this is why we conceptualized the public domain<br>
omnipresent innovations gettin deep in your brain<br>

new creations rely on the shoulders of giants<br>
can't construct disruptive developments minus defiance<br>
true societal progress should be based on alliance<br>
rock a peer review method like this is hard science<br>

divisive legal battles only benefit the bigwhigs<br>
here on the bottom we're stuck with free craigslist gigs<br>
but there's hope in the heart of every musician i know.<br>
and we put it all out there like a free sideshow.<br>

**INSERT LAWRENCE LESSIG**

who owns the future? that's what we ask<br>
half full glass, web platforms tap that cask<br>
while the middle class gets buried in a stratified casket<br>
record execs stack residuals in a basket<br>
any chance of policy reform, they will mask it<br>
when they drop new singles like a tisket, a tasket<br>

look at the gumption as they exploit prosumption!<br>
no break from the workday, you better bring your lunch in!<br>
<br>
such a narrow range of options<br>
we're busking to our coffins<br>
we don't see any other way to go<br>
but i'm still grinning and running<br>
hope a new day's coming<br>
even though it's surely coming slow<br>
