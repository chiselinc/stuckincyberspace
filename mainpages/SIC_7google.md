## Lyrics

i handed the reins of my life right to google<br>
i like their free apps! i'm foolish and frugal!<br>
G-cal on my phone, I'm so organized<br>
hand my private emails to their prying eyes<br>
<br>
no disguise, real name gives me NSA fame<br>
getting sickly complacent as I'm playing the game<br>
corporate gaslighting, fighting but they say they won't be evil<br>
who defines what that means, methods seem a bit medieval<br>
<br>
and even now their arbitrary maps decide<br>
where fiercely contested borders of nations lie<br>
new colonizers stomping round the globe like sovereignty despisers<br>
<br>
<i>i still don't know just how i feel<br>
i can see overall this is such a raw deal<br>
but the ethical problems seem distant<br>
i'm lacking resistance<br>
<br>
like sure i got nervous<br>
when i scanned the terms of service<br>
the violations are subtle but persistent<br>
so blink and you'll miss them<br></i>
<br>
google books plagiarize as they cache human knowledge<br>
they treat their workers well but only if they went to college<br>
with white collar bus shuttles, yummy snacks<br>
true facts, ideas are slapped with patent sneak attacks<br>
forget hacks, the infrastructure's too big to fail<br>
privatize the schools, digitize trademarked braille<br>
i'll topple your false meritocracy<br>
and i'd like to see you try to be stoppin me.<br>
<br>
how is duck duck go supposed to compete<br>
with a company that adds a new server farm each week<br>
monopolize the market, they creep and they sneak<br>
the prospect for fair competition looks bleak<br>
<br>
profit-driven private sector feeding on the data header<br>
big brother snuggles us<br>
while he smothers us<br>
search result hierarchy slowly muzzles us<br>
ashes turn to dust<br>
but metadata don't disintegrate it rusts<br>
<br>
as the cookies respawn<br>
the user is a pawn<br>
no accountability for the creator<br>
and every web browser is a traitor.<br>
<br>
wham, bam, thank you steve rambam<br>
for the info, goddamn<br>
"google's got the whole internet in live RAM"<br>
<br>
and i'm getting tackled by the adwords<br>
sticking with me stubborn like hitchcock's birds<br>
targeted messages stampede like herds<br>
larry page and sergey brin,<br>
congratulations, you win,<br>
but sellouts don't deserve to be called nerds.<br>
<br>
<i>so i still don't know just how i feel<br>
i'm pretty sure in the end this is a gruesome deal<br>
but everyday i'm tired and lazy<br>
the path less taken seems complex and crazy<br>
<br>
i fear it falls back to when you feel this frozen<br>
you can rationalize to yourself that you've chosen<br>
to consume a slow poison, malignant for real<br>
as long as it comes in such a tasty meal.<br><br>
such a tasty meal they're serving-<br>
but the tradeoff is unnerving.</i>
