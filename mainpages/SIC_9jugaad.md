[Thesis Essay: *Jugaad-a* Be Kidding Me: Re-learning Resourceful Innovation From the Global South](/pdfs/chelsea_palmer_2015_SIC_essay8.pdf)

<h2 id='lyrics'> Lyrics </h2>

my nation was built on colonialist privileges<br>
spent its inaugural period exploiting indigenous villages<br>
history is written primarily by he who loots and pillages<br>
nobody seems to care when it ends in a few oil spillages.<br>
<br>
somewhere along the line progress got stuck<br>
we wore out our tools and depend on luck<br>
got me pullin out my hair, and i hope you don't care if i swear<br>
cos the whole world's fucked.<br>
we perpetuate the energy suck and maintain planned obsolescence<br>
keep on trading a possible future for such a wasteful present.<br>
<br>
electricity's trickle-down history!<br>
leave my laptop plugged in, but say waste is a mystery.<br>
oversight, out of mind<br>
fresh concrete laid over the traces we'd find<br>
of our own footprint just stompin out the blind butterfly in jurassic times<br>
ripple effects surely beget reminders of our dismal crimes.<br>
<br>
first world problem, race to the bottom<br>
construct these conundrums, now we can't solve em<br>
let's set aside our egos, the world don't revolve em<br>
admit our mistakes or no one will absolve em<br>
<br>
we think we're so smart, with our noses in the air.<br>
our trash chokes the earth, but we just don't care.<br>
<br>
oh my, global north, jugaad-a be kidding me!<br>
look to emerging markets that are breaking free<br>
education is crucial to human beings' autonomy<br>
and equitable access to resources is a skeleton key to be free.<br>
<br>
()<b>x2</b>) who's more impressive?<br>
scarface or macguiver?
king of an evil empire or a creative survivor?<br>
<br>
resilience is a primary source of pure brilliance.<br>
resistance plus persistence transcends distance.<br>
with reasonable assistance for self-sufficient subsistence<br>
global citizens could pursue a relatively sovereign existence.<br>
<br>
i'm a little too wordy, little too weird.<br>
lil wizard just tryna grow into my beard.<br>
so tl;dr on my views- if you teach a man to fish<br>
he might just teach you how to spice it up and reinvent the dish.<br>
<br>
(<b>x2</b>) who's more impressive?<br>
scarface or macguiver?
king of an evil empire or a creative survivor?<br>
