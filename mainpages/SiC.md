# Stuck in Cyberspace [2016]

## Abstract

The album “Stuck in Cyberspace” kind of happened by accident. Writing her eponymous Master’s thesis, Chelsea Palmer started scribbling down rhymes about her research to let off steam. This became the primary outlet for her continued sanity, and in the growing collection of lyrics msGNU emerged.

Each song is paired thematically with an essay of 2500-3500 words. These are written in easily digestible language targeting the average layman. They can be downloaded <here>. The ultimate project here is to excite those outside the tech industry about its looming possiiblities.
