# **"Stuck in Cyberspace" - The 2016 Rap Album**

### The album “Stuck in Cyberspace” kind of happened by accident.

I was in grad school, buried in theory, trying to understand social patterns and structures of power in the information age. All that seriousness got stifling real fast - so I started scribbling down rhymes to let off steam.

### Each song is based upon a different segment of [my eponymous thesis](SIC_essays).
These are written in an informal, blog-style narrative, and they reference both traditional theorists and less formal online sources. They can be [viewed and downloaded here](/mainpages/SIC_essays). Each essay is also available on the page of its companion song.

Within these essays, online sources are hyperlinked, but books and articles I acquired IRL are only inline cited. To find out more about these sources, click through to the [Bibliography](/pdfs/chelsea_palmer_2015_SIC_bibliography.pdf), hit Control + F and type in the author's last name as cited.

### I think laughter and learning belong in the same space.
I intend, with the songs and videos, to open up the door of stuffy academia, where brilliant research and ideas are paywalled and others are shrouded in overly complicated language. However, [Schoolhouse Rock](https://web.archive.org/web/20160102033445/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SchoolhouseRock) style education should only be the entry point for further inquiry. If you hear something in a msGNU song that you'd like to learn more about, the companion essay might be of use, and we have a whole Internet at our fingertips to explore, of course!
