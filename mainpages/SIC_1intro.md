## Lyrics

everywhere i go, it's the topic<br>
and everyone i know, we can't stop it<br>
everywhere i go, it's the topic<br>
and everyone i know, we just can't stop it<br>

exponential change leaves us caught up in the current<br>
wanna question this, but the comfort's a deterrent<br>
and now it's gone worldwide<br>
globalized, so you can't hide<br>
digital page, spotlit stage<br>
your tarnished pride<br>

as tech shapes us, we shape it back<br>
close the windows, i'm gonna have a mac attack<br>
my linux distro might give me guff<br>
at least i have control over my own stuff<br>

and i love the fair licensing we shape as a squad<br>
free libre open source like giving grace to some god<br>
thanks, soundcloud fam, for the creative commons beats<br>
can't stop, cos the music makes me wanna move my feets<br>

and the only gats i bust are gatsby quotes<br>
i wanna analyze the ways in which the world is broke<br>
cos blockchain style transparency might just fix it!<br>
hit corporate corruption with a two piece and a biscuit!<br>

everywhere i go, we chat about it<br>
and everyone i know can't live without it<br>
everywhere i go, we chat about it<br>
but everyone i know can't live without it<br>

got the slickest slav squat on the soviet bloc<br>
i want to be your bill nye or your schoolhouse rock<br>
cos learning! is fun!<br>
when it's sandwiched! with laughs!<br>
and i'm less depressed when i'm playful with my crafts!<br>

(**x2**) my geeky voice squeaks<br>
not a bug, it's a feature<br>
and i rap like miss frizzle<br>
so call me your teacher<br>

everybody on board buckled in tight?<br>
brace yourself, we're gettin stuck in cyberspace tonight<br>
everybody on board buckled in tight<br>
brace yourself, we're gettin stuck in cyberspace tonight.<br>
