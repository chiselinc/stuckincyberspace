## Lyrics

once upon a time there was a big bad war<br>
or two or more, i'll stay vague so i don't bore<br>
combat influenced the invention of hardware<br>
parallel to oppenheimer's nuclear death stare<br>
<br>
then in comparison, similarly harrowing<br>
initial internet infrastructure carried in<br>
by the US department of defense,<br>
cos ARPANET made a lot of sense<br>
as a failsafe plan for when the damage got dense<br><br>
"mission control come in, come in,<br>
the phones are down, but did we win, we win?<br>
Decentralized networks, we can rebuild again....""<br>
<br>
<i>So we can trace computers' roots to top-down control<br>
It's a chunk of the picture but it's not the whole<br>
We owe an equal debt to hacker academics who worked hard with their heart and soul<br><br>
Typing till carpal tunnel sets in with the allnighter blood sweat and tears,<br>
the software we share is free as in knowledge, and not free as in beers<br>
the tension between surveillance and liberation<br>
structural constraint and grassroots innovation<br>
has been twisting and shifting for ICT's last hundred years.</i><br>
<br>
of course I've got a crush on richard stallman<br>
teeheehee, MIT, please give me a call when<br>
you need more troops for the **FREEDOM** battles<br>
expose the source code till the corporate brat tattles<br>
proprietary infant putting patents on the rattle<br>
sensible folk see that knowledge isn't chattel<br>
every time they knock us down we're back in the saddle.<br>
solving puzzles like scrabble they call us filthy rabble.<br>
<br>
i write to honor the memory of aaron swartz<br>
targeted as a scapegoat by archaic courts<br>
we demand progress and significant change<br>
in the current laws which seem dark and strange<br>
<br>
right now sharing information gets you more jail time<br>
than stabbing up a stranger in a night crime<br>
might not change much, short rope double dutch<br>
but it keeps me stuck on this sad rhyme.<br>
<br>
<i>So if we relegate cyberspace to top-down control
<br>
giving an inch at a time takes its toll<br>
databases expand<br>
while they're shaking your hand,<br>
while they're choking your soul.<br>
while they're shaking your hand<br>
and it's choking your soul.</i><br>
<br>
past data profiles a perfect picture of you<br>
what you think, what you say, what you’ll probably do<br>
today and then tomorrow, if you beg steal or borrow<br>
infinite history, inquisition’s sweet sorrow<br>
<br>
your microchipped arm is no cause for alarm<br>
the warlords in charge, they don’t mean you no harm<br>
and you can check your email as long as they can look too<br>
missing fliers posted up on youtube cos they took you<br>
into super secret custody, indulging their police state gluttony<br>
didn’t even say goodbye so it flustered me<br>
wish i could have helped you to escape cos you trusted me<br><br>
if my white hat heart heard their jackboots coming<br>
we coulda grabbed our hard drives and got to running<br>
it’s feeling like time to hide, to hide<br>
from what this world’s becoming<br>
<br>
<i>and all human history was a fight for control<br>
davey versus goliath,<br>
maybe john connors versus skynet<br>
we can stay defiant<br>
try to slay this giant</i><br><br>
pocket full of bitcoin to buy ourselves a boat<br>
encrypt that little ship,<br>
use tor to ford the moat<br>
but i know if i left it all without a note<br>
the regret of not fighting might close up my throat.
