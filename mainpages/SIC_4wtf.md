<!-- ## Background & Credits

And perhaps strangest of all is msGNU's Foucault-chasing wedding dress. Nana and her mother handmade it for her 1949 wedding. She wanted to just get rid of it,

I wanted to instead highlight it, give it a second life. It fits perfectly and I dyed it blue and painted the binary code for *msGNU* on the front.

I will take care of it to the best of my ability, even long after it stops fitting. It will be a marker of the hardworking, kind, and loving woman who raised four kids on her own in small town New England. -->

<h2 id='lyrics'> Lyrics </h2>

What the Foucault?<br>
Sayin who the Michel<br>
He's got all the other theorists perplexed as hell<br>
So go ahead and yell<br>
Cos you fear you don't get it<br>
Or just open up your ears<br>
So I can hit you quick wit it<br>
<br>
First thing to know - power isn't some sovereign force<br>
Dorks think they can charge overlords with sharpened forks<br>
We all perpetuate<br>
The structures that we say we hate<br>
If there's an oppressive system<br>
We had a bit to create<br>
<br>
As in we implicate ourselves in it<br>
This ain't a lottery or race, we can't win it,<br>
and I'll get to that more thoroughly in just a minute<br>
<br>
For now suffice to say power is a network of strategies<br>
I'm just the messenger so don't get mad at me,<br>
Instead of words real control plays out through our anatomy<br>
this reality is simultaneously terrifying and so rad, you see<br>
<br>
The panopticon doesn't work the way some people think it do<br>
It really make the prisoner do all the surveillance for you<br>
If you don't know when you're watched, it might as well be all the time<br>
We used to take a pound of flesh, now we brand you for your crime<br>
<br>
*power is tolerable as long as it masks its true intentions<br>
we adapt our behaviour to routine social conventions<br>
our acquiescence constructs the present, i forgot to mention<br>
the illusion of total inclusion trickles down like a pension*<br>
<br>
Wonder what the hell is water as the fish grow wetter<br>
Discipline and index, hang a scarlet letter,<br>
Indelibly ink your legal name in a ledger,<br>
label your deviance with shame, it works better<br>
<br>
Render bodies docile with proscribed practices<br>
Free actions are fossils, we'll make you think you asked for this<br>
Normative behaviour adapts to the episteme!<br>
What was once acceptable is rendered as a fading dream!<br>
<br>
They'll call you mad and put you on a ship of fools<br>
you confess about sex, the priest quietly drools<br>
pure biopower growing thicker by the hour<br>
productive not repressive, concrete cracks for the flower<br>
<br>
systemic classification sometimes makes me feel hated<br>
but my body's just an object to be manipulated<br>
regimented blurry-eyed rituals of health<br>
preoccupied by technologies of the self<br>
<br>
there are things we love about the way we're oppressed<br>
button up your favourite brand name as you get dressed<br>
social systems wouldn't last without giving us pleasure<br>
gettin dizzy as we chase what we're taught to call treasure<br>
and we consent to resented commands even within our leisure<br>
