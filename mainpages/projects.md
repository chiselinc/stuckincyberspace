# **Current and Future Projects**

## Events


### - April 2017

There are many exciting developments afoot within the decentralization community in Vancouver, BC. The week of April 3-8th, for example, has turned into a veritable **Blockstravaganza**, with multiple blockchain-focused events.

**[April 4: IEEE Blockchain Special Interest Group Presents the First Annual Blockchain Industry Summit](http://blockchain.ieee.org/2017-blockchain-summit/)**

**[April 5: Human Data Commons Foundation (in association with IEEE) Presents the Blockchain "BCSides" Free Community Event](http://stuckincyber.space/2017/bcsides2017)**

**April 5 (Evening): Decentralized Autonomous Soiree -- MORE INFO TO COME, it will be a rollicking good time at dctrl with homebrewed beer!**

**[April 7 & 8: Local Node of Global Coinfest 2017](https://www.meetup.com/bitcoinvan/events/237974269/)**

### - Ongoing

Additionally, **dctrl hackerspace** has frequent events, and you can keep track of them on [our meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/dctrlvan/).

## Education

### - Dissemination of General Blockchain Resources

**I have compiled a "living document" of intro to blockchain resources and opportunities to engage in the space, [located here](http://stuckincyber.space/2017/blockchain_resource_sheet_2017)** -- I welcome suggestions for further links, please post [as comments on the relevant github issue](https://github.com/chiselinc/stuckincyberspace/issues/4).

### - Curriculum for Widespread and Decentralized Implementation

#### + dctrl free school prototype

From March 20 to April 20, I am conducting an early test run for an ideally long term project-- cultivating video playlists on dynamic topics in tech, which can be used anytime and anywhere to anchor discussion groups and co-learning environments. More information, and the existing cultivated playlists, can be [found here](http://stuckincyber.space/2017/schule).

#### + Information Security Workshops

The [Human Data Commons Foundation](http://www.humandatacommons.org) is currently in discussions with various partner organizations, working to design and implement workshops on information security and privacy. The intro level courses will be targeted to people who are first-time users of online bank accounts and who have had very little exposure to tech education. Intermediate workshops will help enhance users' awareness of their own rights, the industry best practices they can demand, and more advanced tools and methods they can use to protect their privacy online. Please get in touch if you're interested in contributing to this project, or in having us implement it for your organization when it's fully formed [approximately Fall 2017!].


## Activism and Large Scale Vision

### - Ethics in Technology

* I believe free and open source software can serve as a shining example for how to better distribute resources globally, while reshaping the definition of value and reinvigorating collaboration.

My personal statement on Copyright


If we have to use a "fenced in" centralized platform like Youtube we should at least exercise as much freedom as possible within it. The more people who consciously choose CC/free licenses, the greater the connections, sampling, collaborations, etc upon this platform will be. Please refuse the automatic "Youtube Standard License" when you upload your work; you can even set a Creative Commons license as the default for your account, within the Creator Studio settings. That way, you can set it and forget it.


* GNU GPL
* Creative Commons
* Point to resources like EFF and OpenMedia

<!-- She hopes to maintain even a fraction of the integrity and determination demonstrated by Richard Stallman and the way he lives his life. She enthusiastically supports the work of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Internet Archive, and the Creative Commons organization. She tries to learn more everyday about the new revolution of decentralization, from blockchain technology to IPFS. -->
