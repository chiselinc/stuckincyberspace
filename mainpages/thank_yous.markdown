# Thank Yous

MsGNU owes everything in her life to her family, including her amazing and loving Nana, Jane Palmer.

She owes her entry into the F/OSS activism movement to Jayson Munro, who installed her first Linux distro at a bonfire party many years ago.

She hopes to maintain even a fraction of the integrity and determination demonstrated by Richard Stallman and the way he lives his life. She enthusiastically supports the work of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Internet Archive, and the Creative Commons organization. She tries to learn more everyday about the new revolution of decentralization, from blockchain technology to IPFS.

Throughout her research a few contemporary writers came up over and over as crucial commentators on the information age: these include Ursula Franklin, danah boyd, Lawrence Lessig, Geert Lovink, Ray Kurzweil, Siva Vaidhyanathan, and Jos<e> van Dijck. A couple hundred more excellent writers can be found in the <bibliography>.

She would never have completed her thesis project, and thus this follow-up, without her advisors Dr. Darien Thira and Dr. Richard Smith, as well as her professor Dr. Bethan Lloyd. Similarly, she relied upon the support of a wide network of friends, too many to be properly named.

As far as the music videos, she owes any technical skills she has to her former Video Production professor, Larry Burke. She wouldnâ€™t have a scrap of footage without her Director of Photography, best friend, and cinematic life-partner Max Lauf.

She is indebted in her visual aesthetic to heroes who she could never hope to emulate, only admire-- primarily John Waters, Hal Hartley, Michel Gondry, Jonas <A>kerlund, and Frank Zappa.


### We Are Nothing Without the People We Love

Most consistently and crucially in *stuck in cyberspace*; I used possessions that belong to my Nana. These  had been collected and boxed up after she moved to a nursing home. She lived with us my whole life, and she's incredibly important to me.

Nana loved Kirk from the very first episode of Star Trek TOS, and the Shatner pictures are hers. Cloth backdrops, cowboy alarm clocks, clay animals-- these are all Nana's. I want to honour her quirky and beautiful taste in decoration and surroundings to the best of my ability.

And perhaps strangest of all is msGNU's Foucault-chasing wedding dress. Nana and her mother handmade it for her 1949 wedding. She wanted to just get rid of it,

I wanted to instead highlight it, give it a second life. It fits perfectly and I dyed it blue and painted the binary code for *msGNU* on the front.

I will take care of it to the best of my ability, even long after it stops fitting. It will be a marker of the hardworking, kind, and loving woman who raised four kids on her own in small town New England.
