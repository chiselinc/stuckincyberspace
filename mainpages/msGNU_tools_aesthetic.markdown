Public Domain and Creative Commons content on Youtube.

If we have to use a "fenced in" centralized platform like Youtube we should at least exercise as much freedom as possible within it. The more people who consciously choose CC/free licenses, the greater the connections, sampling, collaborations, etc upon this platform will be. Please refuse the automatic "Youtube Standard License" when you upload your work; you can even set a Creative Commons license as the default for your account, within the Creator Studio settings. That way, you can set it and forget it.

Like 75% of my editing is just jumpcuts and colour manipulation.
