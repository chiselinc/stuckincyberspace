Like 75% of my editing is just jumpcuts and colour manipulation.

## Slapdash Aesthetic

### There's No Accounting for [Childish] Taste

I've never produced something polished or smooth. I like the dollar store and the backroom junk at Goodwill. And I like to reuse everything I've ever owned until it breaks down into pieces.

I like nostalgia, uneven edges, and bright colours. And jump cuts.  I don't care how jarring they are, I'll always take a hard cut over a proper transition.

In short, I share my aesthetic tastes with a lot of 6 year olds. I never grew out of goofy Crayola-style crafts, and I don't intend to. This is what makes me laugh, and laughing keeps depression, confusion, and exasperation at bay. I mean, if you're into it, you're into it. If not, there are plenty of other music videos in the sea.

As long as I can tool around with goofy stuff, I'll be happy.

### Budget as Cheap as the Day is Long

I've generally produced all of my artistic projects on a near-zero budget, except for going out of pocket on weird stuff from dollar stores and thrift stores. In addition to this Yankee-spirited thriftiness, the majority of the props and costumes used for "Stuck in Cyberspace" hold great personal significance for me. These videos are filled with objects from my childhood home and 15+ year old outfits (because I stopped getting taller at age 14). Most significantly, the live

Some of it may not fit or make sense. I brought it in anyways because to me, art is deeply personal. Clothes I decorated when I was 16, my two dolls from when I was young. It's almost as though layering my current artistic output with the vestiges of the past 20 years helps me tie up loose ends, psychologically. I take the time to appreciate the pieces of the puzzle, the little details that shaped who I am today.
