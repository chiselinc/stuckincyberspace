## Slapdash Aesthetic

###There's no accounting for taste, eh?!##

I've never produced something polished or smooth. My tastes trend toward MS Paint and Crayola; my fashion sense hasn't changed since age 6.

I like nostalgia, randomness, and uneven edges. Bright colours and jump cuts [Like 75% of my editing is just jumpcuts and colour manipulation].
<!-- I don't care how jarring they are, I'll always take a hard cut over a proper transition. -->
<!-- In short, I share my aesthetic tastes with a lot of 6 year olds. I never grew out of goofy Crayola-style crafts, and I don't intend to.  -->

This stuff is what makes me laugh, I have genuine fun with it. It certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea, I know.


### Budget as Cheap as the Day is Long

I've generally produced all of my artistic projects on a near-zero budget. The times I did pay for props or backdrops, it was exclusively at the dollar store and the backroom junk at Goodwill. I like to reuse everything I've ever owned until it breaks down into pieces.

### Using Pieces of the Past

In addition to this Yankee-spirited thriftiness, the majority of the props and costumes used for "Stuck in Cyberspace" hold great personal significance for me. These videos are filled with objects from my childhood home, and crazy clothes from when I was a teenager.

For this project, the 1-2 hours that it took to set up, plan, and execute each shoot (which would result in, at most, half a minute of edited footage) gave me time to appreciate the artifacts of my childhood home as pieces in the puzzle of my near 30 years. I'd highly recommend occasional immersion in nostalgia, it's invigorating.

### Personal Thank Yous

I owe everything in my life to my family. A loving mother who sweetly, selflessly takes care of the people around her. A badass father who will stand up, and work for, what's right, no matter what. A super cool older brother who introduced me to amazing music and film long before I would have found it on my own. An awesome and funny extended family.

And my Nana, Jane Palmer-- this project is dedicated to you. You helped raise me, made my childhood so much fun, and have always been a source of love and support through to the present day. You're the best!!!

She would never have completed her thesis project, and thus this follow-up, without her advisors Dr. Darien Thira and Dr. Richard Smith, as well as her professor Dr. Bethan Lloyd. Similarly, she relied upon the support of a wide network of friends, too many to be properly named.

### Tech/Production Thank Yous

I've been #blessed to work closely with my BFF and "cinematic life partner" Max Lauf, whose lighting and framing instincts are on point. I think the sharp and precise skill of his cinematography nicely balances the "screw it, we'll do it live!" style of my directing. Unsurprisingly, shooting film with good friends is exponentially more enjoyable.

Jayson Munro set up my first install of Ubuntu about 5 years ago, on a whim at a house party. I got super into computers from that point onward, and the change in my path has made me really happy. Also Jay mastered the audio on this album. Thank you so much, dude.

Acre Stowe is an amazing producer, with an impeccable ear for levels and detail. Thanks for the studio access, and the tireless cycle of tweaks and feedback. All the backing beats were originally pulled about 2 years ago from Creative Commons collections on Soundcloud [except for the beat for Sharecon, which was created by good friend Sean Goggins!]. The artists whose beats I used are generous and kind, and you can hear more of their music here:

* Rey Topol
* ChIll Boogie

<!-- I would never have written any of these songs if it weren't for the academic and theoretical inspirations which sparked them off. The [Bibliography](/pdfs/chelsea_palmer_2015_SIC_bibliography.pdf) is an exhaustive list of the six-month-cram-session of reading that allowed this to happen. To pick a few favourites:

* David Beer
* Siva Vaidhyanathan
* Ursula Franklin
* danah boyd
* Lawrence Lessig
* Geert Lovink
* Ray Kurzweil
* Jose van Dijck
* Mark Poster -->


MsGNU

She owes her entry into the F/OSS activism movement to Jayson Munro, who installed her first Linux distro at a bonfire party many years ago.

She hopes to maintain even a fraction of the integrity and determination demonstrated by Richard Stallman and the way he lives his life. She enthusiastically supports the work of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Internet Archive, and the Creative Commons organization. She tries to learn more everyday about the new revolution of decentralization, from blockchain technology to IPFS.

Throughout her research a few contemporary writers came up over and over as crucial commentators on the information age: these include Ursula Franklin, danah boyd, Lawrence Lessig, Geert Lovink, Ray Kurzweil, Siva Vaidhyanathan, and Jos<e> van Dijck. A couple hundred more excellent writers can be found in the <bibliography>.



As far as the music videos, she owes any technical skills she has to her former Video Production professor, Larry Burke. She wouldnâ€™t have a scrap of footage without her Director of Photography, best friend, and cinematic life-partner Max Lauf.

She is indebted in her visual aesthetic to heroes who she could never hope to emulate, only admire-- primarily John Waters, Hal Hartley, Michel Gondry, Jonas <A>kerlund, and Frank Zappa.
