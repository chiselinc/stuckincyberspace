My three core passions are education, activism, and forging alliances.

If you're looking for information on my professional accomplishments and interests, the most useful place would probably be my [LinkedIn page](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/chelsea-palmer-79280ab5).

MsGNU
The death of Aaron Swartz, specifically, shook her out of her academic stupor and mobilized her to learn, to act, to pursue a new path. Once she started digging into the philosophy of free software, well, forget about it-- her life was changed.

If we canâ€™t rally the masses for informed and purposeful adoption of innovative technology, the greatest strides we make will be drowned out by the increasingly siloed realm of the consumerist and surveillance-driven Web. Maybe more stakeholders will climb on board if we take ourselves much less seriously.

<!-- ## Ethical Standpoint and Personal Identity

* statement on american citizenship effect on willful data blindness
* black lives matter, gender politix, but men's issues are important also -->

## Copyright Philosophy

If we have to use a "fenced in" centralized platform like Youtube we should at least exercise as much freedom as possible within it. The more people who consciously choose CC/free licenses, the greater the connections, sampling, collaborations, etc upon this platform will be. Please refuse the automatic "Youtube Standard License" when you upload your work; you can even set a Creative Commons license as the default for your account, within the Creator Studio settings. That way, you can set it and forget it.

### Personal Thank Yous

I owe everything in my life to my family. A loving mother who sweetly, selflessly takes care of the people around her. A badass father who will stand up, and work for, what's right, no matter what. A super cool older brother who introduced me to amazing music and film long before I would have found it on my own. An awesome and funny extended family.

And my Nana, Jane Palmer-- this project is dedicated to you. You helped raise me, made my childhood so much fun, and have always been a source of love and support through to the present day. We share a taste for quirky knick-knacks, so most of what I use in the videos is your cool stuff!

I never could have completed my thesis project, and thus this follow-up, without my advisors -- Dr. Darien Thira and Dr. Richard Smith -- as well as my professor Dr. Bethan Lloyd. Similarly, I relied upon the support of a wide network of friends, too many to be properly named. Love you all.



<!-- Pursuit of Learning:
* **Stage One**: hearing a topic or idea in casual conversation
* **Step Two**: casually looking up initial info from web search and/or Wikipedia
* **Step Three**: evaluation of sources, engaged in deliberate dialogue with others
* **Step Four**: orderly exploration of more formal sources and larger frameworks
* **Step Five**: keeping an open ear and mind, aiming always to learn more -->
