# **Tools I Use and Endorse**

### Core Computer Stuff
* [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)  -- this is where caring about technology started for me
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) -- for website dev
* [Github](https://github.com/) -- for collaboration, and hosting this site
* [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) -- favorite desktop environment thus far, I utilize it with my favorite tools:
  * [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) -- video editing
  * [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) -- image editing
  * [Atom](https://atom.io/) -- for editing code and all text documentation
  * [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) -- for sound recording
  * [Synaptic](http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/) -- my preferred package manager, the documentation on packages is really well organized and presented

### Academic Writing Setup

My life has been changed by switching from .doc files to writing entirely in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). I'm more efficient, it's easier to get into a writing "flow", and editing later drafts is much simpler.

I'd like to see the useful interfaces used by programmers and developers to be adopted by a wider user base -- pretty much anyone who does the majority of their work on a computer could potentially benefit from switching to [Markdown](http://devdocs.io/markdown/).

I would recommend, as above, [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io/) for maximum functionality and flexibility. From there, the addition of [Pandocs](http://pandoc.org/) and Atom packages like [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) and [Markdown to PDF](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-pdf) allows an intuitive and efficient setup for notetaking, blog text production, and document composition.

Simple markdown files can be synced across devices with your usual/prefered cloud services, and there are a couple of great markdown-friendly mobile editors: [iaWriter for iOS and Android](https://ia.net/writer) and [Jotterpad just for Android](https://2appstudio.com/jotterpad/).

These two sources go into more thorough and effective detail about setting up a writing process flow:

### I've Knowingly Sold My Soul to Some Less Free-as-in-Freedom Platforms

Gulp. The unstable balance between freedom and comfort, idealism and convenience. Unlike [Stallman](gnu.org), I'm no angel in this regard.

* [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil) -- I tease them in [this song](SIC_7google.html) but I depend upon their services to manage 80% of my life
* [Dropbox](mainpages/SIC_7google.md) -- they got me hook, line, and sinker nearly a decade ago, and now hold so much of my data it would take days to download and store elsewhere
* [Trello](https://trello.com/) -- haven't yet found a F/OSS Kanban Board as convenient
* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/a/queue/list/) -- when I save things to read later, I like them to be cohered into simple text and saved offline!
* [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/) -- this Chrome/Firefox extension has changed my life -- incredibly flexible collapsing/organization of open browser tabs
