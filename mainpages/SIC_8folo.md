## Lyrics

wake up in the morning, where's my cellphone, cellphone<br>
lifeline heartbeat, i listen for the ringtone<br>
phantom vibration in my pocket<br>
notification pops up so quick, i gotta rock it<br><br>
wrestling with autocorrect, i whine and i moan<br>
ursula franklin said we're all together alone<br>
like paul simon i'm just a rock, a little island,<br>
but in my profile picture you can bet that i'm smilin<br><br>
no denying we're performing in a worldwide sphere<br>
sousveillance spreads through nations,there's no such thing as 'here'<br>
there's just 'everywhere'<br>
cyberspace is not a place<br>
you read my words and just take it on faith<br>
that this is my real face-<br>
overlooking the potential for catfish disgrace.<br><br>
attention economy overload<br>
supposed autonomy but i might explode<br>
turn off my gps and try to lay low<br>
don't call myself an athlete unless my fitbit say so<br><br>
all of these terrible wearables, useful but scary<br>
big data's pig's blood dumped on me like carrie<br>
if you opt out of Facebook now, you're a luddite<br>
overexposure or privacy, fight the good fight.<br><br>
hey danah boyd - i'm overjoyed<br>
at the cyborg social networks we've all employed<br>
instagram narcissists may get us annoyed<br>
but glowing screens still pull us gladly into the void<br><br>
stare into the abyss, the fact will stare back<br>
that omnipresent availability invents its own lack<br>
desperate connectivity, new anxiety<br>
striving for microcelebrity notoriety<br><br>
i still know that there's something else inside of me<br>
that wants to be free in the way that i used to be<br>
little kid climbing alone to the top of a tree<br>
empty pockets, and no need for anyone else to see.
