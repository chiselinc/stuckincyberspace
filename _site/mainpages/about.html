<p>MsGNU
The death of Aaron Swartz, specifically, shook her out of her academic stupor and mobilized her to learn, to act, to pursue a new path. Once she started digging into the philosophy of free software, well, forget about it– her life was changed.</p>

<p>If we can’t rally the masses for informed and purposeful adoption of innovative technology, the greatest strides we make will be drowned out by the increasingly siloed realm of the consumerist and surveillance-driven Web. Maybe more stakeholders will climb on board if we take ourselves much less seriously.</p>

<!-- ## Ethical Standpoint and Personal Identity

* statement on american citizenship effect on willful data blindness
* black lives matter, gender politix, but men's issues are important also -->

<h2 id="copyright-philosophy">Copyright Philosophy</h2>

<p>I aim to use primarily Creative Commons and Public Domain licensed footage in my work; however, there is unfortunately a dearth of that on current day Youtube (something I hope to help change!). In some cases, I have used content that is listed under the Standard YouTube License, in the understanding that short-form sampling for educational rap would be considered Fair Use. Please contact me at IM.ms.GNU@gmail.com if you disagree and would like me to remove your footage from this video.</p>

<h2 id="personal-thank-yous">Personal Thank Yous</h2>

<p>I owe everything in my life to my family. A loving mother who sweetly, selflessly takes care of the people around her. A badass father who will stand up, and work for, what’s right, no matter what. A super cool older brother who introduced me to amazing music and film long before I would have found it on my own. An awesome and funny extended family.</p>

<p>And my Nana, Jane Palmer– this project is dedicated to you. You helped raise me, made my childhood so much fun, and have always been a source of love and support through to the present day. We share a taste for quirky knick-knacks, so most of what I use in the videos is your cool stuff!</p>

<p>I never could have completed my thesis project, and thus this follow-up, without my advisors – Dr. Darien Thira and Dr. Richard Smith – as well as my professor Dr. Bethan Lloyd. Similarly, I relied upon the support of a wide network of friends, too many to be properly named. Love you all.</p>

<!-- Pursuit of Learning:
* **Stage One**: hearing a topic or idea in casual conversation
* **Step Two**: casually looking up initial info from web search and/or Wikipedia
* **Step Three**: evaluation of sources, engaged in deliberate dialogue with others
* **Step Four**: orderly exploration of more formal sources and larger frameworks
* **Step Five**: keeping an open ear and mind, aiming always to learn more -->
